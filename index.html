    <pre><h3>Title: ‚ÄúAnunay‚Äôs Coding Odyssey‚Äù</h3>

        In the mystical realm of ones and zeros, where curly braces dance and semicolons waltz, there resides a
         young adventurer named Anunay Naman. Armed with a keyboard and a heart full of curiosity, he embarks 
         on a quest to conquer the elusive art of coding. His journey begins at the hallowed halls of Anand 
         Prep Public School, where he once puzzled over algebraic equations and dreamed of pixelated dragons.
        
        Anunay, with his unruly mop of hair and glasses perched precariously on his nose, attended his first 
        programming class. The professor, a seasoned developer with a penchant for puns, welcomed the 
        fledgling coders. ‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúprogramming is like baking a cake. Except the cake is a 
        website, and instead of flour, you use HTML.‚Äù
        
        Our hero nodded solemnly, determined to master the arcane incantations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
         He spent countless nights huddled over his laptop, typing furiously, occasionally muttering, ‚ÄúWhy 
         won‚Äôt this div align properly?‚Äù His roommate, equally baffled, offered sage advice: ‚ÄúMaybe the div 
         needs therapy.‚Äù
        
        As Anunay delved deeper into the labyrinthine world of web development, he discovered the secret 
        society of Stack Overflow. There, wizards in hoodies shared ancient scrolls containing snippets of 
        code. Anunay, too, contributed‚Äîa humble offering of a typo fix‚Äîbut was rewarded with upvotes and 
        virtual high-fives.
        
        And so, armed with newfound knowledge and a penchant for procrastination, Anunay decided to launch his 
        own website. It would be a tribute to his journey‚Äîa digital scrapbook of syntax errors, triumphs, and 
        the occasional existential crisis. The homepage would proudly declare:
        
        ‚ÄúAnunay Naman‚Äôs Code Haven: Where Bugs Fear to Tread‚Äù
        
        And now, dear reader, brace yourself for the pi√®ce de r√©sistance‚Äîthe grand finale that will leave you chuckling and scratching your head simultaneously:
        
        An Ode to Debugging
        
        Oh, bugs, you elusive creatures,
        You hide in loops and nested features.
        Anunay chased you through the night,
        His code ablaze with desperate might.
        
        He squinted at the screen's harsh glow,
        Syntax errors mocking him‚Äîoh no!
        "Is it a missing semicolon?" he cried,
        As the debugger grinned, eyes wide.
        
        He Googled, he prayed, he cursed the fates,
        Yet bugs persisted, mocking his dates.
        "Perhaps," he mused, "they're just shy,
        Or maybe they're on vacation‚Äîoh my!"
        
        So he sprinkled breadcrumbs of console logs,
        Hoping the bugs would reveal their cogs.
        But they danced away, elusive sprites,
        Leaving him baffled in the moon's pale light.
        
        And thus, dear friends, let this be known:
        Coding's a journey, not a throne.
        Anunay, with his quirky charm,
        Will conquer bugs and raise no alarm.
        
        So visit his site, laugh and explore,
        For bugs beware‚ÄîAnunay's at the door!
